# Ouroboros: Quantum-Resistant Symmetric-Key Protocol for IoT

A lightweight, stateful cryptographic protocol designed for secure communication in closed IoT ecosystems, with particular focus on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi.

## Project Overview

Ouroboros is a novel quantum-resistant symmetric-key protocol specifically designed for secure IoT communications. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on asymmetric cryptography vulnerable to quantum attacks, Ouroboros uses only symmetric-key primitives and hash functions to achieve quantum resistance while maintaining lightweight operation suitable for embedded devices.

The protocol addresses the unique challenges of IoT environments: limited computational resources, intermittent connectivity, and the need for long-term security in a post-quantum world. By implementing a stateful ratcheting mechanism with robust state synchronization, Ouroboros provides forward secrecy and resilience against device compromise.

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Industrial IoT sensor networks
- Smart meter deployments
- Medical device communications
- Any closed ecosystem where devices communicate with a central server

## Key Features

### üîê Quantum Resistance
- **No asymmetric cryptography**: Completely avoids number theory-based algorithms vulnerable to Shor's algorithm
- **Symmetric primitives only**: Built entirely on AES, SHA-3, and HKDF
- **Future-proof security**: Resistant to both classical and quantum attacks

### ü™∂ Lightweight Operation
- **Raspberry Pi optimized**: Designed for resource-constrained devices
- **Minimal computational overhead**: Fast symmetric operations only
- **Low memory footprint**: Efficient state management

### üîÑ Forward Secrecy
- **Key ratcheting mechanism**: Automatic key evolution after each message
- **Compromise resilience**: Past messages remain secure even if current key is compromised
- **Perfect forward secrecy**: Each session key is cryptographically independent

### üîó Robust State Management
- **Synchronization handling**: Automatic recovery from lost messages
- **Counter-based tracking**: Message ordering and gap detection
- **Device reboot resilience**: State persistence across power cycles

## Protocol Outline

### 1. Initial Provisioning
- **Pre-shared key (PSK) distribution**: Master secret embedded during manufacturing/provisioning
- **Device registration**: Each device receives unique PSK with central server
- **Secure bootstrapping**: Initial state establishment

### 2. Key Derivation
- **HKDF-based expansion**: Master PSK stretched into key chain using HMAC-SHA256
- **Deterministic generation**: Both parties derive identical key sequences
- **Key isolation**: Each session key cryptographically independent

### 3. Ratcheting Mechanism
- **Hash-based evolution**: State updated after each message using SHA-3
- **Bidirectional ratcheting**: Both sender and receiver advance state
- **Forward secrecy guarantee**: Previous keys cannot be recovered

### 4. State Synchronization
- **Counter inclusion**: Each message contains sequence number
- **Gap detection**: Receiver identifies missing messages
- **Catch-up mechanism**: Automatic ratcheting to synchronize states
- **Bounded recovery**: Configurable maximum synchronization window

### 5. Message Processing
- **Encrypt-then-MAC**: AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
- **Replay protection**: Counter-based message ordering
- **Integrity verification**: HMAC validation of all messages
